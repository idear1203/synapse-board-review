## Champion Scenarios


* **Champion Scenario 1:  List Caller's role assignments.** 
  * User wants to get all role assignments they are assigned.
  * Link to the code sample: [JAVA]() | [TS](./samples/Typescript/sample.md#)

* **Champion Scenario 2: List role definitions of synapse.**
  * User wants to get all role definitions. These definitions are provided by Synapse, user can't modify it.
  * Link to the code sample: [JAVA]() | [TS](./samples/Typescript/sample.md#)

* **Champion Scenario 3: Create role assignments for specified user/service pricipal.**
  * Workspace Admin wants to set pecified user/service pricipal as a specified role. For example, administrator can set developerA as SQL Admin using this function.
