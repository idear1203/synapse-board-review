## Artifacts required (per language)

We use an API review tool ([apiview](https://apiview.azurewebsites.net)) to support .NET and Java API reviews.  For Python and TypeScript, use the API extractor tool, then submit the output as a Draft PR to the relevant repository (azure-sdk-for-python or azure-sdk-for-js).

## Champion Scenarios


* **Champion Scenario 1:  Create/Submit a spark batch job.** Developer wants to run a Spark job Once the job is complete, they need to see the results
  * Customer wants to submit a spark batch job to the spark pool of azure synapse workspace to do some analytics work by using apache spark.
  * Customer who want to run spark batch job must use this api, so more than 80% of developers using the service who would use the champion scenario
  * Link to the code sample: [C#](./samples/DotNet/sample.md#scenario-1-spark-bacth-job-creation) | [Python]() | [JAVA](./samples/Java/sample.md#scenario-1-spark-bacth-job-creation) | [TS](./samples/Typescript/sample.md#scenario-1-spark-bacth-job-creation)

* **Champion Scenario 2**: Developer/Administrator needs to maintain the pool of workers; for this they need to be able to list the jobs in queue, including finding which one is currently running and potentially cancel or delete them from the list. 
* Champion Scenario 2.1: Get a spark batch job
  * Customer wants to get the information of a submitted spark batch job. For example, customer wants to know whether the job has been ran successfully, where the log is etc.
  * Customer who will submit job to spark pool must use this api to check whether the job's state and other information. So more than 80% of developers using the service who would use the champion scenario
  * Link to the code sample: [C#](./samples/DotNet/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel) | [Python]() | [JAVA](./samples/Java/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel) | [TS](./samples/Typescript/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel)

* Champion Scenario 2.2: List all spark batch jobs under the specific spark pool
  * Customer wants to list all submitted spark batch jobs under a specific spark pool of azure synapse
  * Customer wants to manage the submitted spark batch jobs will use this api, so more than 30% of developers using the service who would use the champion scenario
  * Link to the code sample: [C#](./samples/DotNet/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel) | [Python]() | [JAVA](./samples/Java/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel) | [TS](./samples/Typescript/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel)
* Champion Scenario 2.3:  Cancel a spark batch job
  * Customer wants to cancel a submitted spark batch job. For example, customer may want to cancel a job when there is a logic error in the program or the job is in a unexpected state for a long time.
  * Customer will this api when they find that there is a logic error or the job is not needed will use api, so more than 40% of developers using the service who would use the champion scenario
  * Link to the code sample: [C#](./samples/DotNet/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel) | [Python]() | [JAVA](./samples/Java/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel) | [TS](./samples/Typescript/sample.md#scenario-2-spark-bacth-job-get-list-cancel)

* **Champion Scenario 3:  Create a spark session.** Developer wants to run a Spark session for interective analytics.
  * Customer wants to create a spark session to the spark pool of azure synapse workspace to do some analytics work by using apache spark.
